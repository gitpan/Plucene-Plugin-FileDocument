NAME
    Plucene::Plugin::FileDocument - turn a file into a document

SYNOPSIS
      my $writer = Plucene::Index::Writer->new(...);
      $writer->add_document(Plucene::Plugin::FileDocument->new($filename));

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Plucene::Document subclass for indexing an entire file on
    disk.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
      $writer->add_document(Plucene::Plugin::FileDocument->new($filename));

    This loads the file with the given name, and turns it into a
    Plucene::Document.

    By default two Text fields will be created: 'path', which is the full
    name of the file, and 'text' which is the content of the file.

    Extra fields can can be added by passing a hash of { fieldname => subref
    } pairs to the constructor:

      $writer->add_document(Plucene::Plugin::FileDocument->new($filename, 
        lastmod => sub { (stat(+shift->{path}))[9] },
      );

    These subrefs will be passed a hashref of the 'path' and 'text'.

CUSTOMISATION
  document_class / field_class
    By default we assume you are using Plucene::Document and
    Plucene::Document::Field. If you are using subclasses of these instead,
    then you should override these methods accordingly.
